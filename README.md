# SalonSync – Smart Walk-In Queue Manager for Salons

"Walk in. Wander out. Be back just in time."

SalonSync is a modern, smart queue management system built for salons and barbershops. It eliminates the need for appointments or long waits by allowing walk-in customers to scan a QR code, register instantly, and receive real-time notifications about their place in the queue. While waiting, users can explore nearby deals, track their return time, and receive personalized service suggestions — all without downloading any app.
